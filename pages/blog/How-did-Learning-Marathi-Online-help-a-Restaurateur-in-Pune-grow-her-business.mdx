## Noopur's commitment to Unparalleled Customer Satisfaction
<br/>
Noopur runs a restaurant in Pune. The joint is not only frequented by locals but managed by Marathi-speaking staff. Running a kitchen that customers swear by has always been Noopur’s cherished dream. Working with locals to add a homegrown flavour to her delicacies was also part of her vision.
<br/>
While both goals did come true, there was a small hurdle that kept nagging her again and again. Hailing from Chattisgarh, Noopur didn’t know how to speak Marathi. This meant she could not coherently converse with her Marathi-speaking customers. More importantly, she always found it difficult to seamlessly communicate with her staff. 
<br/>
It was something that always bothered the self-made businesswoman. The one missing link that could take her business skills to the next level. With a keen eye for detail, a passion for guest relations and her dedication to delivering exceptional hospitality, Noopur knew that the only way to clear this obstacle was by upskilling her linguistic prowess. It was time to professionally learn Marathi. 
<br/>
<br/>
## How to Learn Marathi Amidst a Busy Schedule?
<br/>
Due to her busy schedule of running multiple businesses, Noopur started looking for Marathi classes online. As luck would have it, Noopur came across an online Marathi learning program that provided weekly Marathi classes according to her timings and convenience. “Is that all it takes?” Noopur wondered as she too enrolled in the same course. 
<br/>
That small leap of faith turned out to be a blessing in disguise as she entered the incredible world of language learning. This wasn’t an ordinary course. It was designed to make people understand Marathi rather than mugging up a few basic phrases.

## After Learning Marathi Online with Shilpa Ma'am
<br/>
By the time the course was coming to an end, Noopur had already started talking to her staff in Marathi and welcoming her customers in the local tongue. This development did have a tangible benefit for businesses too. 
<br/>
