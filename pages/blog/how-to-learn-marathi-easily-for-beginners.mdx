## Getting Started with the Basics: Learning Marathi for Beginners
To begin your Marathi learning journey, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the language's basic building blocks. Here are some key areas to focus on:

### 1. How To Write Marathi Alphabet
The Marathi alphabet consists of 36 consonants (व्यंजनं) and 16 vowels (स्वरं). The consonants with their English script sound equivalents are:
- क (ka), ख (kha), ग (ga), घ (gha), ङ (ṅa)
- च (ca), छ (cha), ज (ja), झ (jha), ञ (ña)
- ट (ṭa), ठ (ṭha), ड (ḍa), ढ (ḍha), ण (ṇa)
- त (ta), थ (tha), द (da), ध (dha), न (na)
- प (pa), फ (pha), ब (ba), भ (bha), म (ma)
- य (ya), र (ra), ल (la), व (va)
- श (śa), ष (ṣa), स (sa), ह (ha)
- ळ (ḷa), क्ष (kṣa), ज्ञ (jña)

The vowels with their English script sound equivalents are:
- अ (a), आ (ā), इ (i), ई (ī) 
- उ (u), ऊ (ū), ऋ (ṛ), ॠ (ṝ) 
- ऌ (ḷ), ॡ (ḹ), ए (e), ऐ (ai) 
- ओ (o), औ (au), अं (aṁ), अः (aḥ)

These vowels can be written independently or as diacritical marks attached to consonants to create syllables.

### 2. How To Pronounce Marathi Correctly
Proper pronunciation is crucial for effective communication in Marathi. While the Devanagari script provides a clear representation of the sounds in the language, it is essential to pay attention to the unique characteristics of Marathi pronunciation. One key aspect is the distinction between aspirated and unaspirated consonants. Aspirated consonants, such as ख (kha), छ (cha), ठ (ṭha), and फ (pha), are pronounced with a strong burst of air, while their unaspirated counterparts, क (ka), च (ca), ट (ṭa), and प (pa), are pronounced without the extra breath.

Another important feature of Marathi pronunciation is the presence of retroflex consonants, such as ट (ṭa), ठ (ṭha), ड (ḍa), ढ (ḍha), and ण (ṇa). These sounds are produced by curling the tongue back and touching the roof of the mouth. It may take some practice to master these sounds, but listening to native speakers and imitating their pronunciation will help you improve.

In addition to consonants, Marathi also has a range of vowel sounds that are distinct from English. For example, the vowels ए (e) and ओ (o) are pronounced with a slight glide, similar to the "ay" in "say" and the "o" in "go," respectively. The vowel ऋ (ṛ) is a short, retroflex sound that does not have a direct equivalent in English. 

To master Marathi vowel pronunciation, listen closely to native speakers and practice reproducing the sounds accurately. 

### 3. How To Learn Basic Marathi Vocabulary
To start building your Marathi vocabulary, focus on common terms and phrases used in everyday conversations. Here are some essential vocabulary lists to get you started:

#### Greetings and Basic Phrases
- नमस्कार (namaskār) - Hello

- धन्यवाद (dhanyavād) - Thank you
- माफ करा (māf karā) - Sorry

#### Question Words

- कोण (koṇ) - Who
- कुठे (kuṭhe) - Where
- केव्हा (kevhā) - When

- कसे (kase) - How

#### Family Members
