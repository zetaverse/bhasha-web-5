Earlier I could only speak Tamil & Kannada and my colleagues and I had difficulty replying to customers and understanding them when they spoke English. For this reason, the Namma Yatri Mahila Shakti team arranged spoken English classes to help us learn English. We attended Bhasha's English speaking classes twice a week and were happy to meet our language teacher Sudha Ma'am. She helped us learn English from Tamil and always corrected us when we made mistakes. Today I am so happy that I can speak in English with anyone. Even when I go to my kid's school, I can talk in English with the class teacher. I can also speak to bank staff in English. These classes have been really helpful and useful for me. Thank you Namma Yatri for giving us the chance to learn English with Bhasha.io",
