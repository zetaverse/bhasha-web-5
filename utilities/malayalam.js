      "I joined Bhasha’s Malayalam Language Classes to better communicate with my Malayalam-speaking clients. Anupama Ma'am is an excellent coach—she explains meanings, usage, tone, and pronunciation clearly, often using multiple languages to make things easier. Her flexibility with class timings was especially helpful given my unpredictable work schedule. Thanks to her and the well-designed course, learning Malayalam has been a smooth and rewarding experience. I highly recommend both the course and the coach to anyone looking to learn the language.",

      "After moving to Calicut six years ago, I had been trying to learn Malayalam without much success—until I found Bhasha’s Malayalam classes online. Asha Ma'am was a wonderful mentor—patient, supportive, and especially helpful with pronunciation, which can be quite challenging in Malayalam. The online Malayalam learning experience was smooth and flexible, fitting perfectly into my schedule. Thank you, Asha Ma'am and the Bhasha team!",

She was always helpful, ready to answer questions and solve doubts and her deep knowledge of the subject is evident. At my request she even taught me numbers, and the names of months and days. I recommend her as a very good teacher for students who want to learn Malayalam online.",

      "I joined Bhasha two months ago because I really wanted to be able to speak in Malayalam. So I looked up and found Bhasha's Malayalam Speaking course online. Miss Ritu took my spoken Malayalam classes. I attended three classes per week and completed assignments and sent them to Miss Ritu. There used to be so many mistakes. In spite of this, Ritu Ma'am slowly corrected me word by word and helped me to express myself. I started watching Malayalam films and series. I am just starting to speak Malayalam fluently and my confidence has increased",

My instructor Reshmi Ma'am was very knowledgeable and incredibly patient, creating a supportive environment where I felt comfortable making mistakes and learning from them. The emphasis on practical conversation skills was what I appreciated the most.

The classes were also infused with cultural insights, giving me a deeper understanding of the language's context and nuances. The course materials provided were comprehensive and well-designed, making it easy to continue learning outside the classroom. The flexibility of the schedule was also a huge advantage, allowing me to balance my other commitments while still progressing steadily on my Malayalam learning journey. I'm genuinely grateful for the experience and the incredible support from the instructor Reshmi Ma'am. I can confidently say that I've made significant strides in speaking Malayalam fluently, thanks to this fantastic course. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn Malayalam effectively.",
