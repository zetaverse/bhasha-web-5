      "Divya Vinil was my teacher for the Malayalam reading and writing course of 20 classes. She was a sincere and diligent teacher, ensuring the course was completed on time. She was always helpful, ready to answer questions and solve doubts and her deep knowledge of the subject is evident. At my request she even taught me numbers, and the names of months and days. I recommend her as a very good teacher for students who want to learn Malayalam online.",

      "I joined Bhasha two months ago because I really wanted to be able to speak in Malayalam. So I looked up and found Bhasha's Malayalam Speaking course online. Miss Ritu took my spoken Malayalam classes. I attended three classes per week and completed assignments and sent them to Miss Ritu. There used to be so many mistakes. In spite of this, Ritu Ma'am slowly corrected me word by word and helped me to express myself. I started watching Malayalam films and series. I am just starting to speak Malayalam fluently and my confidence has increased",

      "My name is Dr Bhavya. I'm a gynecologist by profession...recently moved to Thalassery and started working in a hospital in Kannur. Hailing from Ranchi, Jharkhand I was very apprehensive about moving to a place with an entirely different culture and language. So I enrolled in Malayalam speaking classes at Bhasha. Divya, my instructor made it so easy for me..from basics to advanced - the entire course was very well structured. All thanks to her I'm able to speak Malayalam with people now.",

I opted for the complete program of the spoken Malayalam course as well as reading and writing. She was an extremely patient, compassionate, and dedicated teacher. I would recommend her to anyone looking to learn Malayalam!",

After the completion of my Malayalam speaking course with the help of Bhasha, I could recollect my spoken Malayalam and converse with good fluency and confidence. I am very happy that I took these Malayalam classes online and met such an excellent Malayalam language coach. I am satisfied.",

      "I am sincerely grateful for the exceptional Malayalam course I attended at Bhasha Institute, led by the incredibly dedicated Reshmi Ma'am. Her guidance and support were invaluable, consistently clearing my doubts and enhancing my language skills. Rashmi Ma'am's commitment to correcting pronunciation significantly enriched my Malayalam learning experience. The lessons were informative and enjoyable, fostering a positive learning environment. I commend the institute for its commitment to language education. Once again, thank you, Reshmi Ma'am, and Bhasa Institute, for an enriching language-learning journey.",

      "I was not confident about learning Malayalam. However, this course exceeded my expectations in every way. The curriculum was well-structured, catering to various proficiency levels. My instructor Reshmi Ma'am was very knowledgeable and incredibly patient, creating a supportive environment where I felt comfortable making mistakes and learning from them. The emphasis on practical conversation skills was what I appreciated the most. Each class was engaging, filled with interactive sessions and assignments that helped me apply what I learned immediately. The classes were also infused with cultural insights, giving me a deeper understanding of the language's context and nuances. The course materials provided were comprehensive and well-designed, making it easy to continue learning outside the classroom. The flexibility of the schedule was also a huge advantage, allowing me to balance my other commitments while still progressing steadily on my Malayalam learning journey. I'm genuinely grateful for the experience and the incredible support from the instructor Reshmi Ma'am. I can confidently say that I've made significant strides in speaking Malayalam fluently, thanks to this fantastic course. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn Malayalam effectively.",
