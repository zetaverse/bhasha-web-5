I wanted to learn Hindi as I would be taking assignments in 2 or 3 north based corporates from sept' 21. The fact that I had to work with Hindi speaking personnel in the north based corporate/s made learning Hindi a must at this point in my career. And the spoken Hindi course from Bhasha Hindi proved extremely useful. They have a very structured course which eases our learning process. I've been doing one-to-one lessons with Uma Madam and learning how to read and write Hindi, as well as working on my pronunciation, vocabulary, and basic conversational skills. She is a kind and patient teacher with a wealth of knowledge to share. Dhanyawad team Bhasha and Uma Madam for the help and support during the 2 months of my learning." },

Later I joined MBBS in a state where it was mandatory for me to know basic Hindi so I got to know about Bhasha's Online Hindi Speaking Classes. I was quite skeptical at the beginning as how would they help us learn Hindi in just 20 sessions that too online but it was beyond my expectations. Rumana ma'am was amazing. I would wait to attend her class always because I learned new things without much difficulties. She was very cooperative and made me a confident Hindi speaker by taking me from the basics to advanced things including grammar. Now I can confidently speak üó£Ô∏è Hindi to my classmates and other people. It was an enjoyable experience learning Hindi online with Bhasha despite my busy MBBS schedule.. Thank you Bhasha and Rumana Ma'am for making my dream come true" },

A big thanks to Bhasha for connecting me with an awesome teacher, Sudha Ma'am. She's kind, patient, and really good at teaching. She helped me a lot with grammar, tenses, and all those tricky noun forms. When I began the course, understanding Hindi was a bit tough. But now, thanks to Sudha Ma'am I can follow conversations well and even make my own sentences. I want to thank Sudha Ma'am and Bhasha for giving me this chance to learn Hindi online. It's been an amazing experience!" },

      "Kavitha mam is the best teacher I could have found to learn Hindi. I'd go as far as to say she is one of the best teachers I have ever encountered.The focus of the classes is on mastering the grammar and speaking (correctly). You'll learn the most basic and important grammar structures first, so you're able to start conversing right after the very first class. I've only taken a week of classes with kavitha mam but I've learnt as much as a month at a regular language. Besides being a professional, Kavitha mam is also a very genuine, kind, patient and funny human being. All in all, learning Hindi with Kavitha mam was the highlight of my career. Whether you're looking to learn basics hindi to get around India or you are serious with your study, I totally recommend Kavitha mam as a mentor.",

I wanted to learn Hindi as I would be taking assignments in 2 or 3 north based corporates from sept' 21. The fact that I had to work with Hindi speaking personnel in the north based corporate/s made learning Hindi a must at this point in my career. And the spoken Hindi course from Bhasha Hindi proved extremely useful. They have a very structured course which eases our learning process. I've been doing one-to-one lessons with Uma Madam and learning how to read and write Hindi, as well as working on my pronunciation, vocabulary, and basic conversational skills. She is a kind and patient teacher with a wealth of knowledge to share. Dhanyawad team Bhasha and Uma Madam for the help and support during the 2 months of my learning.",

      "I'm Supreeth and from South India. Although I had always wanted to learn Hindi, I didn't have the time to devote to it. Later I joined MBBS in a state where it was mandatory for me to know basic Hindi so I got to know about Bhasha's Online Hindi Speaking Classes. I was quite skeptical at the beginning as how would they help us learn Hindi in just 20 sessions that too online but it was beyond my expectations. Rumana ma'am was amazing. I would wait to attend her class always because I learned new things without much difficulties. She was very cooperative and made me a confident Hindi speaker by taking me from the basics to advanced things including grammar. Now I can confidently speak üó£Ô∏è Hindi to my classmates and other people. It was an enjoyable experience learning Hindi online with Bhasha despite my busy MBBS schedule.. Thank you Bhasha and Rumana Ma'am for making my dream come true",

That's when I found out about Bhasha's online Hindi speaking classes. After trying a class, I decided to join because they offered one-to-one sessions and flexible timings, which made it easy for me to finish my level 1 course. A big thanks to Bhasha for connecting me with an awesome teacher, Sudha Ma'am. She's kind, patient, and really good at teaching. She helped me a lot with grammar, tenses, and all those tricky noun forms. When I began the course, understanding Hindi was a bit tough. But now, thanks to Sudha Ma'am I can follow conversations well and even make my own sentences. I want to thank Sudha Ma'am and Bhasha for giving me this chance to learn Hindi online. It's been an amazing experience!",
