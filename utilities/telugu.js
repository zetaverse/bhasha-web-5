After speaking with the Program Advisor I enrolled in their Telugu language classes. My trainer was Madhavi Lata, a true delight. She taught me the core basic keywords which helped me pick up the language easily. She had patience and enthusiasm for teaching. She was approachable and answered all my questions.

I had heard reviews about Bhasha.io and my own research corroborated that. Ms. Amrutha Duvvuri was my Telugu teacher who expertly walked me through the nuances of conversational Telugu and Telugu grammar. I thoroughly enjoyed Ma’am’s teaching, especially her English to Telugu Speaking tips & tricks and clear & lucid explanations. Thanks to her teaching and the excellent resources and practice material provided by Bhasha, I’m now able to converse with my family in Telugu and bring a smile to their faces.

I figured I would take a test run and immediately after the trial class, knew this would be a great option. It was easily one of the best decisions I have made. My instructor (Madhavi Latha) taught me clearly and kept me inspired to press on the whole way, especially when there were difficulties. Madhavi kept every lesson fresh and fun. I cannot recommend this course enough. Thank you Bhasha and thank you Madhavi!"

      "My name is Anas Ali. I'm from Telangana. I'm a doctor who is pursuing a postgraduate degree. My native language is Hindi/Urdu. As Telugu is a widely used language in Telangana and Andhra, I decided to learn this language to build a rapport with patients. I searched how to learn Telugu language online and found Bhasha.io. After speaking with the Program Advisor I enrolled in their Telugu language classes. My trainer was Madhavi Lata, a true delight. She taught me the core basic keywords which helped me pick up the language easily. She had patience and enthusiasm for teaching. She was approachable and answered all my questions. Overall this was an excellent experience and I'm thankful to Bhasha's  Telugu speaking classes.",

      "Hello everyone, I’m Maya. I married my friend Aswani and thus started our journey of togetherness and learning each other’s languages. I hail from Maharashtra and Aswani from Andhra Pradesh. As a means of communicating with my new family members, I decided to enroll in Bhasha's Telugu language classes. I had heard reviews about Bhasha.io and my own research corroborated that. Ms. Amrutha Duvvuri was my Telugu teacher who expertly walked me through the nuances of conversational Telugu and Telugu grammar. I thoroughly enjoyed Ma’am’s teaching, especially her English to Telugu Speaking tips & tricks and clear & lucid explanations. Thanks to her teaching and the excellent resources and practice material provided by Bhasha, I’m now able to converse with my family in Telugu and bring a smile to their faces. Thank you Amrutha ma’am! Thank you Bhasha!",

      "I am Xavier, a native of Kerala and at the age of 50, I had to learn a new language for my work. I approached Bhasha.io and found a structured Telugu language course. It is a very useful and easy course. Within a few weeks I started seeing results in dealing with my clients, thanks especially to Ms. Madhavi Latha, my Bhasha language instructor. I recommend Bhasha to anyone who is worried about how to speak Telugu language with their business clients and vendors. Thank you Ms. Madhavi Latha and the Bhasha.io Team.",

      "I am a language enthusiast and find it very exciting to speak a new language or to be able to understand the locals or their movies. I started taking Telugu classes online with Madhavi Latha as I belong to the North and was curious to learn a South Indian language. So far, the experience has been quite seamless. All the concepts are adequately explained so I can grasp everything properly. Looking forward to the Telugu language learning experience ahead.",

      "Kudos to the Bhasha team for assigning Madhavi Lata Madam for teaching me Telugu. The way of teaching is superb. Madhavi ma’am makes me comfortable and knows how to teach a new language! The interactions are informal with a lot of clarity. With only 10 classes, I can converse in Telugu with native speakers now. Thank you so much. This is the best Telugu learning course online.",

      "Hi I am Dr. Narmada, presently working as an additional professor in a hospital in Telangana. Though I have lived in Telangana for a long time, I had not learned to speak in Telugu. I realised that I needed to understand and speak Telugu to communicate better with the patient. So I enrolled in Bhasha's spoken Telugu classes which I came across while browsing the internet. Now I can feel the difference after attending the classes. My Telugu speaking ability has improved. I am more proficient in Telugu than before. My teacher was Haseena Ma'am, who is a very knowledgeable teacher with extensive knowledge and patience. She helped me whenever I needed and I recommend BHASHA's online Telugu learning classes with special thanks to Haseena Ma'am.",

It turned out to be a really enjoyable trip for me. Thanks to Bhasha's spoken Telugu course and my language coach Haseena Ma'am. They helped me learn Telugu and provided flexibility in class timings. As a professional with a busy schedule I really appreciate this.",

      "I learned Telugu from my Telugu coach, Madhavi ma'am. She is a wonderful teacher who puts a lot of thought and effort into her teaching. Her lessons are really engaging, informative, and helpful. Telugu, no doubt is a difficult language for a north Indian but she really made it easy to understand by using her Hindi to Telugu speaking exercises. Along with a big ‘THANK YOU’ I would highly recommend her and Bhasha's Telugu speaking course to anyone interested in learning.",

      "Hello! My name is Michael. I’m an American from New York who works in Finance. I became interested in learning the Telugu language because it’s my fiancé’s native tongue; her and her family are originally from Andhra Pradesh. Towards the end of 2022, I started looking specifically for Telugu Language learning in English and stumbled upon Bhasha. I figured I would take a test run and immediately after the trial class, knew this would be a great option. It was easily one of the best decisions I have made. My instructor (Madhavi Latha) taught me clearly and kept me inspired to press on the whole way, especially when there were difficulties. Madhavi kept every lesson fresh and fun. I cannot recommend this course enough. Thank you Bhasha and thank you Madhavi!",
