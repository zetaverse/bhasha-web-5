I became interested in learning the Telugu language because it’s my fiancé’s native tongue; her and her family are originally from Andhra Pradesh. Towards the end of 2022, I became interested in finding a way to learn the Telugu language and stumbled upon Bhasha. I figured I would take a test run and immediately after the trial class, knew this would be a great option. It was easily one of the best decisions I have made. My instructor (Madhavi Latha) taught me clearly and kept me inspired to press on the whole way, especially when there were difficulties. Madhavi kept every lesson fresh and fun. I cannot recommend this course enough. Thank you Bhasha and thank you Madhavi!",

I'm very glad to have discovered Bhasha - their spoken Marathi course is clear and easy to follow, and they paired me with an excellent instructor. Mrs. Madhavi is patient and encouraging, and has really helped me learn spoken Marathi online. My wife has been astonished by my progress, and she is very likely to use Bhasha to improve her Tamil.",
