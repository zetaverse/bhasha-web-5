However, this was not an easy task, especially because me and my wife lived outside India during this period, and reliable resources are difficult to find online. I started searching for ways to learn Marathi language online and I'm very glad to have discovered Bhasha - their spoken Marathi course is clear and easy to follow, and they paired me with an excellent instructor. Mrs. Madhavi is patient and encouraging, and has really helped me learn spoken Marathi online. My wife has been astonished by my progress, and she is very likely to use Bhasha to improve her Tamil." },

I joined Bhasha’s Marathi Language Course, and from the very first demo, Kavitha ji filled me with confidence and motivation. Each session was a joy. Her patience, encouragement, and ability to explain complex Marathi words in English and Hindi made learning Marathi online both effective and enjoyable. Despite living in Bangalore with limited exposure to Marathi, I gradually gained confidence, from understanding just 30–40% to now understanding nearly everything and speaking with 70% fluency. Kavitha ji’s energy, support, and flexibility made all the difference. The course content was practical, well-structured, and perfect for adult learners like me. I’m so glad I chose Bhasha and feel extremely fortunate to have had Kavitha ji as my mentor. It’s been a fulfilling journey of not just language, but personal growth",

      "I have been learning to speak Marathi for the last few weeks and now I can communicate with my local patients better. My Marathi coach Madhavi Ma'am is an excellent teacher. I appreciate her patience and diligence in teaching. Thank you for your efforts. I have asked my sister who is also planning to take Marathi classes online only with Madhavi Ma'am. And recommend her to anyone who wishes to learn Marathi online. Thank you Bhasha.io",

      "My name is Amudhan, and I'm a mathematician currently working in the Netherlands. Having married into a Marathi family, I have wanted to learn Marathi for some years now. However, this was not an easy task, especially because me and my wife lived outside India during this period, and reliable resources are difficult to find online. I started searching for ways to learn Marathi language online and I'm very glad to have discovered Bhasha - their spoken Marathi course is clear and easy to follow, and they paired me with an excellent instructor. Mrs. Madhavi is patient and encouraging, and has really helped me learn spoken Marathi online. My wife has been astonished by my progress, and she is very likely to use Bhasha to improve her Tamil.",

      "My name is Pranay Sharma and I am a mechanical engineer working in Pune. I realised that learning Marathi would help me in communicating more freely and developing a stronger bond with the local people. I searched for Marathi classes for beginners on the internet. My search for an ideal platform ended with Bhasha.io. The format of learning the language through one-to-one guidance from the teacher worked perfectly for me. Their Marathi speaking course content has been designed to help beginners move from basic to advanced levels in a smooth manner. I would sincerely like to express gratitude towards my teacher Madhavi ma’am for being such a superb teacher and an equally wonderful person to interact with. I wish her and the entire Bhasha team all the best for the future.",

      "I had a fantastic learning experience learning Marathi language online with Archana Ma'am. I found the teaching methodology to be very effective; structured in a conversational manner. Amidst all the bells and whistles involved in learning a language, it made sense going through the essentials and how it compares with the languages I already know. She encouraged me to try out new sentences every time and reduced my fear greatly. Many thanks to Archana Ma'am and Bhasha's Marathi learning course",

      "My name is Melody. I am an educator. I am from Manipur and live in Mumbai. My daughters are in an international school in Maharashtra. Marathi is an optional subject, but I want them to learn it. I am not well-versed in the language. So, I started searching for Marathi speaking classes online and found Bhasha.io on Google search. The teacher, Shilpa helped me understand the minute details and grammar of the language. She helped to clear the confusion of gender, sentence construction, and pronunciation. My sincere thanks go out to Shilpa and Bhasha.",

This online platform is really helpful for learning new languages. My Marathi tutor, Madhavi Ma'am was very accommodating and conducted my Marathi classes as per my schedule. And she taught in a very effective manner so I could learn Marathi through English easily. It has been a very good experience for me to finally be able to learn to speak Marathi.",

      "Me and my husband are retired professionals from Gujarat and we spend a lot of time in a small town in Maharashtra. We thought being conversant in a language that is spoken locally would help us connect better with the local community and we found 'Bhasha.io' which helps you learn spoken Marathi online. We took the classes jointly and we want to share our happy experience of learning Marathi with Madhavi Ma'am. Her patience and dedication were evident in all the classes she took. Moreover, her amiable personality and light-heartedness took away the pain of learning and made us look forward to taking her class every week. After taking the classes we are more confident in our communication in Marathi and thank the Bhasha Team and Madhavi Ma'am for helping us overcome our hesitations in speaking Marathi.",

      "Hi, I am Rishi Bhatia. I have lived in Pune for the past 15 years but hadn't learned to speak Marathi. Since I work offshore, I looked for Marathi speaking classes online and found Bhasha.io. They briefed and clarified all my initial queries very nicely and so I enrolled in their Marathi speaking course in Sept 2023. My language coach Madhavi Ma'am is a great teacher of the Marathi language. She helped me learn the basics of Marathi very well. Her way of teaching is also very nice and she is willing to assist a lot and keeps the class very interactive and interesting. Presently I can converse in Marathi. I thank Madhavi Ma'am and Bhasha.io for the same.",

For this, I enrolled in the 'Marathi classes for beginners' at Bhasha.io and met Madhavi Ma'am. It has been a great experience learning from her! She has provided a solid foundation and understanding of concepts to better grasp the language, making it easier to learn in-depth, with fun examples and references. Thanks to her, I'm able to communicate easily with the locals and colleagues at my workplace. "Tya khoop chaan marathi sheekavatet " :)`,
