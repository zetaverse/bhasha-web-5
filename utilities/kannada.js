In one month's time, I was able to read my school Kannada books. Not only that, I scored 13 out of 15 on my first-ever Kannada class test. All thanks to my teacher Divya ma'am for teaching Kannada to me so well that I can now cope with my class pretty well.

But when I switched to academics and started teaching I realised the importance of learning the local language and that learning Kannada would be a great help for me and for my future life. I approached Bhasha.io who assigned Shilpa Ma'am as my Kannada teacher. I am a proud student of Shilpa Ma'am. Shilpa Ma'am has been teaching me for the last 4 months. I finished learning Kannada reading and writing today. I just completed the last session and I am really proud that at least I got the kind of educated and helpful trainer from Bhasha. I really recommend everybody to have Shilpa Ma'am as their trainer in the Kannada language classes."
