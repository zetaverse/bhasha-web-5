However, this was not an easy task, especially because me and my wife lived outside India during this period, and reliable resources are difficult to find online. I started searching for ways to learn Marathi language online and I'm very glad to have discovered Bhasha - their spoken Marathi course is clear and easy to follow, and they paired me with an excellent instructor. Mrs. Madhavi is patient and encouraging, and has really helped me learn spoken Marathi online. My wife has been astonished by my progress, and she is very likely to use Bhasha to improve her Tamil." },

Their Marathi speaking course content has been designed to help beginners move from basic to advanced levels in a smooth manner. I would sincerely like to express gratitude towards my teacher Madhavi ma'am for being such a superb teacher and an equally wonderful person to interact with.
